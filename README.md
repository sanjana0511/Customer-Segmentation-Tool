# Customer-Segmentation-Tool
🧠 Overview

A data-driven machine learning project that segments customers into meaningful groups based on their demographic and behavioral patterns (age, gender, income, and spending score) using K-Means Clustering.
The goal is to help businesses design targeted marketing strategies, optimize sales, and improve customer retention.

🚀 Features

Uploads customer datasets (CSV or Excel) via an interactive Streamlit web app.

Performs data cleaning, preprocessing, and clustering automatically.

Displays dynamic visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots.

Allows real-time cluster analysis and interpretation of customer behavior.

Generates actionable insights like identifying high-value or at-risk customer segments.

🧩 Technologies Used

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit, Anaconda

Algorithm: K-Means Clustering

🗂️ Modules

Data Analysis & Preprocessing – Handles missing values, encoding, and normalization.
